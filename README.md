# Vision 
 Our vision is to provide crucial information for  Filecoin members to facilitate them in making storage deals.

# Customer & Problem
We are targeting most of the members in Filecoin network as our customers, primarily on clients and miners. Currently, less than 0.1% of the network storage is being utilized, which seems insufficient. Futhermore, there are few services that help clients and miners to make deals. Without an substantial unitilization of the network storage, it defeats the mission of Filecoin network. We are dedicated to solve this problem.

# Solution & Alternatives  
The marketplace we are buidling enables Filecoin clients and miners to make deals easily. One of Filhub's key features is the built-in communication tool which allows miners and clients to talk each other conveniently. As the platform and the network grow, we will release feature that auto-match deals with miners based on certain conditions. Furthermore, we anticipate that clients with large datasets would require several miners to complete their deals. These clients will be able to communicate their deals in the group chat with Filhub as well. Lastly, we have reputation systems for both clients and miners, which assist them to find desired partners and deals.
# Regulation 
Participating in all of the Filecoin Slingshot competitions, FIlhub has closely worked with plenty of miners (including MinerX) around the world, which made Filehub well-known in the network. Filhub team also has close cooperation with traditional internet enterprise and big data team in China such as Onethingtech Wangsu Science & Technology and Oschina. Filhub team also has more than 10 year of experiences in E-commerce and platform operation.

# Traction  
Despite the fact that almost 5 Eib of network storage power has been proven, the actual utilization of the storage is less than 0.1%. There is not a solid service and platform that asist storge deal matching. FIlhub will take over this role.
